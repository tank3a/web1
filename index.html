  <p>Longfellow attended private schools and the Portland Academy.
    He graduated from Bowdoin College in 1825.
    At college he was attracted especially to Sir Walter Scott’s romances and Washington Irving’s Sketch Book,
    and his verses appeared in national magazines.
    He was so fluent in translating that on graduation he was offered a professorship
    in modern languages provided that he would first study in Europe.</p>
</div><div>
  <p>On the Continent he learned French, Spanish, and Italian but refused to
    settle down to a regimen of scholarship at any university.
    In 1829 he returned to the United States to be a professor and librarian at Bowdoin.
    He wrote and edited textbooks, translated poetry and prose,
    and wrote essays on French, Spanish, and Italian literature, but he felt isolated.
    When he was offered a professorship at Harvard, with another opportunity to go abroad,
    he accepted and set forth for Germany in 1835. On this trip he visited England,
    Sweden, and the Netherlands. In 1835, saddened by the death of his first wife,
    whom he had married in 1831, he settled at Heidelberg, where he fell under
    the influence of German Romanticism.</p>

  <h3>The Song Of Hiawatha, “Paul Revere’s Ride,” And Other Poetry</h3>
  <p>In 1836 Longfellow returned to Harvard and settled in the famous Craigie House,
    which was later given to him as a wedding present when he remarried in 1843.
    His travel sketches, Outre-Mer (1835), did not succeed.
    In 1839 he published Voices of the Night, which contained the poems “Hymn to the Night,”
    “The Psalm of Life,” and “The Light of the Stars” and achieved immediate popularity.
    That same year Longfellow published Hyperion, a romantic novel idealizing his European travels.
    In 1842 his Ballads and Other Poems, containing such favourites as
    “The Wreck of the Hesperus” and “The Village Blacksmith,” swept the nation.
    The antislavery sentiments he expressed in Poems on Slavery that same year,
    however, lacked the humanity and power of John Greenleaf Whittier’s denunciations
    on the same theme. Longfellow was more at home in Evangeline (1847),
    a narrative poem that reached almost every literate home in the United States.
    It is a sentimental tale of two lovers separated when British soldiers expel
    the Acadians (French colonists) from what is now Nova Scotia. The lovers,
    Evangeline and Gabriel, are reunited years later as Gabriel is dying.</p>

    <p>Longfellow presided over Harvard’s modern-language program for 18
      years and then left teaching in 1854. In 1855, using Henry Rowe Schoolcraft’s
      two books on the Indian tribes of North America as the base and the trochaic
      metrics of the Finnish epic Kalevala as his medium, he fashioned The Song of Hiawatha (1855).
      Its appeal to the public was immediate. Hiawatha is an Ojibwa Indian who,
      after various mythic feats, becomes his people’s leader and marries Minnehaha
      before departing for the Isles of the Blessed. Both the poem and its singsong
      metre have been frequent objects of parody.</p>
